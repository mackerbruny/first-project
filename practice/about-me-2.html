				<h2>Introduction</h2>	
				<p>I am a graphic and web designer for <a href="http://www.jellcreative.com">Jell Creative</a> who is a part time improvisor in Chicago. I hail from Kalamazoo Michigan — the worlds most fun city to say out loud! Something that not many people know about me is that one of my feet is drastically hairier than the other. I never lie about animal facts.</p>
				<p>I love my friends — they are my family. The faces may change, but having a group of people to care about outside of yourself does wonders for the soul. I also love sauces. I think of food mainly as a vehicle for sauces. If they made steak shaped hunks of BBQ sauce I would probably just eat that instead. Lastly, I'm passionate about problem solving and sharing my knowledge. I really get a kick out of teaching people things they never knew or thought of before. Currently I solve visual and communication problems and I'm looking forward to solving development problems in the future.</p>

				<h2>Where I’m From</h2>	
				<p>Kalamazoo, Kzoo, the zoo, K-town, Celery City, I got a gal in Kalamazoooo. I never knew how much I loved the place until I spent a summer in small tourist town in sothwest Michigan. I grew up there. I went to college there. I fell in love there. I started my criminal career there! Kidding?</p>
